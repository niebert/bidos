Tech Stack
==========

### Client Side Frameworks

[**AngularJS**](angularjs.org)

> AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries.

> The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

+ Because it's made by Google (if that's an argument) and provides all the neccessary capabilities like routing, two-way-data-binding, service-providers etc.

[**React**](facebook.github.io/react)

> A Javascript library for building User Interfaces.

+ Even though it is made by Facebook, it drastically improves page rendering speed and provides a modular and well integrated framework for the V (view) in angular's MVW (Model-View-Whatever) infrastructure.

### Server Side Framework

[**Node.js**](nodejs.org)

> Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

[**Koa**](koajs.com)

> Koa is a new web framework [â€¦] which aims to be a smaller, more expressive, and more robust foundation for web applications and APIs. Through leveraging generators Koa allows you to ditch callbacks and greatly increase error-handling.

+ Because they are slim, fast and easy to code and play very well together with the corresponding front end architecture.

+ Alternative: [Go](golang.org) and the [Gorilla Web Toolkit](gorillatoolkit.org). Because the resulting API would be probably more robust, performant and less error-prone.

> Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

> Gorilla is a web toolkit for the Go programming language.

### Database

[**Redis**](redis.io) for initial development and very likely [PostgreSQL](postgresql.org) as soon as the data models reach a final design state.

> Redis is an open source, BSD licensed, advanced key-value store.

> PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness.

### Server Side Deployment

[**Docker**](docker.com)

> Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.

### Client Side Deployment

[**Cordova**](cordova.apache.org)

> Apache Cordova is a platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

+ Additionally: [RequireJS](requirejs.org) or [Browserify](browserify.org).

### CSS

[**Ionic**](ionicframework.com)

> Free and open source, Ionic offers a library of mobile-optimized HTML, CSS and JS components for building highly interactive apps. Built with Sass and optimized for AngularJS.

[**Sass**](sass-lang.com)

> Sass is an extension of CSS3 which adds nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. Sass generates well formatted CSS and makes your stylesheets easier to organize and maintain.

[**Compass**](compass-style.org)

> Compass is an open-source CSS Authoring Framework.
