CRITICAL
[tables+capture] fix search/filter bar/search by id (fix viewFilter!)

HIGH
[capture] showNextExample not working
[capture] when 'noch nicht', do not ask the help question
[charts] broken! buggy css? angular-charts is crap. use Chart.js or D3 directly (react <3)
[ui] alle buttons und funktionen testen

MEDIUM
[tables] add tabs to views
[help/toasts] toast everywhere
[refact] create type property in backend/db
[resources] show automated resource tables in single tabbed view (less crowded dashboard)
[help/ui] überall einen hilfe button einbauen, auf den ein dialog kommt (help-directive) (luxus, aber ja. help directive dialog)

LOW
[refactor] split up css files
[improv] stop and save capture time
[setup] make server address configurable in app
[ui] add loading indicator everywhere
[ui] switchable views: [agenda, array, carousel, column, day, headline, list, module, quilt, stream, week] (see material design icons)
[resource/inbox] toggle 'show only new' button for scientist on observation resource view
[refact] create tables dynamically (-> one template for all)
[resources] user.role is missing WONTFIX (make roles as strings and save the hassle)
[auth] we need more complex permissions (do we?)
[resources] provide 3 resources: flat (vanilla), nested (automatic getters), anonymized, rolified (SUCKS! shared mutable state is the root of all evil!)
[sidenav] make (automatically) nested sidenav (limit to n levels)
[roles] jeder sollte n anderes theme haben (vielleicht nicht so ohne weiteres möglich)
[resources] generate unique 3 letter ids for each child
[refact] tile factory
[fs] remove bx- from filenames
[resources] create abstract inbox service / get all data and filter out only the new ones
[inbox] have an inbox with just a list of all the stuff happening
[help/ui] alle texte von bedienelementen softcoden (strings.js)
[resources] generate fake data in api on api call
[api] use redis for caching and sync redis with indexeddb (?) WONTFIX
[export] raw data as csv (could be easy but time-consuming, serverside?)



    // TODO refactor the whole resource model. no key:value stuff
    // all over the place but arrays and objs w/ property key:
    // 'kid'. we have that anyway!


    /* TODO: The back end should authenticate the user, check for it's group
    /* and respond with the correct resource object the user is allowed to
    /* get, and not more. (?)


	  // logging out is done on the clients side by deleting the token.
	  // TODO: keep track of deployed tokens
