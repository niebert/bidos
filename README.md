========

The server consists of a back end and a front end.

The back end provides the data API, connects to the database via an ORM (Sequelize), handles authentication and authorization (JWT) and does the routing neccessary to apropriately answer API requests.

The front end provides two user interfaces: (1) one for administration (managing user accounts, deploying new surveys and general maintaineance etc.). (2) Another for scientific analysis of the existing survey data. In the latter, all personal data is anonymized.
